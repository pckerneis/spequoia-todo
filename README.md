# What is this repository?

This repository is a vibe coding experimentation.

I started by creating a specification file ([`spequoia.yaml`](spequoia.yaml)) and asked Windsurf Cascade to implement the
corresponding application and tests.

The experimentation gave pretty good results. I didn't have to write a single line of code. I just tweaked
the specification a bit to get the desired results or fix some bugs.

Windsurf version: 1.6.3
Model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Following is the generated README file.
